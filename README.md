## Project Description
This is a ReactJs web application integrated with firebase. The application helps the user maintain a personal record of daily happenings and reflections, plan the day with the help of a scheduler and organize the tasks undertaken. It features various components to help manage anxiety, reduce stress, prioritize events and keep a track of daily life. Following are the features included:

### Kanban:
Kanban (meaning a signboard in Japanese) is a Japanese scheduling system which aims at improving the efficiency. The kanban board in this application consists of 3 columns to maintain the status (to-do, in-progress, done) of your undertakings.

### Notes:
It is a textfield provided to the user to jot down work-notes and write daily affirmations.

### Pomodoro:
The Pomodoro technique is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals separated by short breaks. The application provides a timer to commit to your task. It can be set/reset as and when requied. 

### Productivity chart:
Track your daily productivity by a visual representation! This line chart allows you to input your daily productivity values and analyse how you've been doing all month.

### Scheduler:
The app also features a scheduler to schedule all your events, both present and future. Descriptive entries such as start-time, end-time, start-date, end-date, event name, etc. can be entered manually. The scheduler was built  with the help of DHTMLX, a JavaScript library.
